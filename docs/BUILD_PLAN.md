# RelativityRender — BUILD PLAN

This file is the live, project-wide log of what has landed and what is next.
Update it after every implementation step, per
`RELATIVITYRENDER_CLAUDE_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` rule 8.

---

## Current State

- **Active milestones:** M2 — Core Engine (in progress), **M3 — Math
  Library (landed)**, **M4 — Image / Framebuffer System (landed)**,
  **M5 — CUDA Device Layer (landed)**.
- **Active branch:** `claude/create-docs-architecture-T2Dp5`.
- **Code in repo:** repository skeleton, top-level CMake project, the
  minimal C++20 application foundation, configuration + CLI handling,
  the math library, the image / framebuffer system, and the GPU
  device layer (backend-agnostic surface in `src/gpu/`, CUDA backend
  in `src/cuda/`, gated by `-DRR_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`). The
  `RelativityRender` executable's `--device-info` now reports the
  compiled-in backend, runs the device query, and prints
  name / compute capability / VRAM / SM count for each visible GPU.
  Three test executables — `math_tests` (42), `image_tests` (39),
  `gpu_tests` (4) — run through `ctest`. `rr_image` and `rr_gpu` are
  static libraries; `RelativityRender` links `rr_gpu`. No CUDA
  kernels yet, no rendering, no scene system.

## Module Status (mirrors `docs/MODULE_MAP.md`)

## Change Log

### 2026-04-27 — M5 CUDA device layer landed

First GPU-aware code in the project. Backend-agnostic surface in
`rr::gpu::`; concrete CUDA implementation in `rr::cuda::`. The host
build still configures and runs without CUDA installed; CUDA is gated
by `-DRR_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`. No kernels, no allocations, no rendering -
just device detection and property queries.

- **`src/gpu/GpuDevice.h` / `.cpp`:** `rr::gpu::GpuDevice` POD struct
  (index, name, compute capability major/minor, total memory bytes,
  multiprocessor count) plus `compute_capability_string()` and
  `total_memory_human()` formatters. Free functions:
  `gpu_backend_available()`, `gpu_backend_name()`,
  `enumerate_devices()`. The `.cpp` `#ifdef RR_HAS_CUDA`-includes
  `cuda/CudaContext.h` and forwards; otherwise it returns
  `"(none)"` / `false` / empty list. Callers never need to know
  whether CUDA was compiled in.
- **`src/cuda/CudaContext.h` / `.cpp`:** `rr::cuda::query_devices()`
  wrapping the CUDA Runtime API (`cudaGetDeviceCount` +
  `cudaGetDeviceProperties`). Robust to driver-init failures: returns
  empty on failure and clears the sticky last-error so a later real
  CUDA call doesn't observe it. Compiled only when CUDA is enabled.
- **`src/main.cpp`:** `--device-info` now logs backend name, prints
  the device count, and emits one line per device formatted as
  `[i] <name> (cc <maj>.<min>, <MiB> MiB, <SMs> SMs)`. When no
  backend is compiled, it logs that explicitly and tells the user how
  to re-enable. When the backend is compiled but no devices are
  visible, it warns instead of pretending to enumerate.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`:** `find_package(CUDAToolkit REQUIRED)` only when
  `RR_ENABLE_CUDA` is ON. New `rr_gpu` static library carrying
  `src/gpu/GpuDevice.cpp`. When CUDA is enabled, `src/cuda/CudaContext.cpp`
  is added to the same library, `RR_HAS_CUDA` is defined PRIVATE, and
  `CUDA::cudart` is linked. The main executable links `rr_gpu`. No
  `enable_language(CUDA)` yet - we only call the runtime API from host
  C++; NVCC arrives in M6 with the first kernel.
- **`tests/gpu_tests.cpp`:** 4 assertions exercising the public surface
  against invariants that hold either way:
  `gpu_backend_name()` is non-empty,
  `available()` and `name() == "(none)"` agree, and
  `enumerate_devices()` is empty when no backend is compiled. Also
  validates `compute_capability_string()` and `total_memory_human()`
  formatters. CI machines without GPUs are valid environments and the
  test is silent about that.

#### Verified locally (host-only configure)

```
$ cmake --build build && cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
1/3 Test #1: math_tests  ............ Passed  0.00 sec
2/3 Test #2: image_tests ............ Passed  0.00 sec
3/3 Test #3: gpu_tests   ............ Passed  0.00 sec
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 3

$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --device-info
[..] [INFO] RelativityRender 0.0.1 starting
[..] [INFO] GPU backend: (none)
[..] [INFO] No GPU backend compiled in.
            Reconfigure with -DRR_ENABLE_CUDA=ON to enable CUDA.
```

The CUDA-enabled path (`-DRR_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`) was not exercised in
this environment (no CUDA Toolkit installed), but is correct by
construction: it relies only on the standard CMake `CUDAToolkit`
package and the `CUDA::cudart` imported target, with all CUDA-specific
sources, defines, and link deps gated on the same `RR_ENABLE_CUDA`
flag that controls the `find_package` call.

#### Module status nuance

`rr::gpu::` is the long-term backend-agnostic surface; the CUDA
backend is one implementation of it. The Module Map's "GPU Device
Layer" (#4) is the surface and is *landed*. The "CUDA Backend" (#5)
will grow to cover streams, buffers, kernel launches, error wrapping,
and pinned memory in M6+; for now it only contains the device-query
plumbing, so it is marked *in progress*.

### 2026-04-27 — M4 image / framebuffer system landed

Host-side pixel storage, set/get/clear/resize, and PPM save (no
third-party dep). PPM is intentionally minimal; OpenEXR/PNG IO arrives
when the GPU paths need real HDR formats.

- **`src/image/Color.h`:** `Rgb` and `Rgba` plain-data structs; both
  `RR_HD constexpr`-friendly so they will be usable from device code
  later. `Rgba` carries `a` defaulted to 1; `Rgba::rgb()` strips it. No
  arithmetic operators yet — premature for image storage; they'll come
  in with shading.
- **`src/image/Image.h` / `.cpp`:** `PixelFormat { Rgb32F, Rgba32F }`
  and an `Image` class with `width/height/format/channels/empty`,
  `set_pixel(x,y,Rgba)`, `get_pixel(x,y)->Rgba` (alpha=1 for Rgb32F),
  `clear(Rgba)`, `resize(w,h)` (zero-fills, format preserved),
  raw `data()` / `size_in_floats()` for future GPU upload, and
  `save_ppm(path)`. Storage is row-major, channel-interleaved,
  contiguous floats (the layout we'll mirror on the device side
  later). OOB pixel access is debug-asserted.
- **`save_ppm`** writes 8-bit P6 binary. Floats are clamped to [0,1]
  and quantized; HDR > 1 is lost; alpha is dropped (PPM has no alpha).
  Empty images return `false`. Honest minimal IO, not a stub: it
  produces files an EXR/PNG viewer can convert and a hex dump can
  validate.
- **`src/image/Framebuffer.h` / `.cpp`:** thin render-target wrapper
  owning a single color `Image`. Provides `color()` (mutable + const),
  `resize`, `clear`, `save_ppm`. AOVs, accumulation buffers, and tile
  metadata join later (M14 / M17). The Image / Framebuffer split is
  intentional: Image is generic 2D pixel storage; Framebuffer is what
  the renderer writes into during a frame.
- **`tests/image_tests.cpp`:** 39 assertions covering Rgba/Rgb format
  set/get round-trip, Rgb32F alpha-on-read = 1, clear, resize zeroes,
  Framebuffer clear + resize, and the **gradient-to-PPM IO
  validation** (verifies header `P6 W H 255` + payload size = W*H*3
  bytes). Empty-image save returns false. The gradient is the only
  CPU-side pixel generation in this module, allowed exclusively as IO
  validation.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`:** first module promoted to a static library —
  `rr_image` (`src/image/{Image,Framebuffer}.cpp` + `PUBLIC` include
  on `src/`). `image_tests` links it; the main executable does not
  yet use it. Same warning flags as elsewhere (`-Wall -Wextra
  -Wpedantic` / `/W4 /permissive-`).

#### Verified locally

```
$ cmake --build build && cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
1/2 Test #1: math_tests  ............ Passed  0.00 sec
2/2 Test #2: image_tests ............ Passed  0.00 sec
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 2
```

`image_tests` reports `39/39 passed`; the gradient is written to
`<temp>/rr_image_test_gradient.ppm`, validated, and removed.

#### Order note

M4 lands before M2's remaining sub-items (`Error`, `FileSystem`,
`App`, `Config::load`/`save`, real test framework, host CI) for the
same reason M3 did: Image depends only on Math (already landed) and a
trivial subset of Core that exists now (none of the deferred Core
pieces are needed here). Per `docs/MODULE_MAP.md`, this respects the
declared dependency direction.

### 2026-04-27 — M3 math library landed

The math leaf is in. Header-only, host/device portable, and exercised by a
small test runner that hooks into `ctest`.

- **`src/math/MathUtils.h`:** `RR_HD` host/device macro (expands to
  `__host__ __device__` under NVCC, empty otherwise), constants
  (`kPi`, `kTwoPi`, `kHalfPi`, `kInvPi`, `kEpsilon`), and templated
  `min` / `max` / `clamp` / `lerp` plus `radians`, `degrees`,
  `saturate`. All `constexpr RR_HD` where possible.
- **`src/math/Vec2.h` / `Vec3.h` / `Vec4.h`:** plain structs with `float`
  members. Constructors include a single-arg `explicit` broadcast to
  prevent accidental scalar→vector conversions. Operator suite covers
  `+`, `-`, unary `-`, scalar `*` and `/`, in-place compound assignments,
  and `==` / `!=`. `Vec3` adds component-wise (Hadamard) `*`. Free
  functions: `dot` (all three), `cross` (Vec3), `length`,
  `length_squared`, `normalize` (returns zero on degenerate input
  rather than NaN). Free overloads of `clamp` and `lerp` for `Vec3`
  pick up the file's component-wise semantics without conflicting with
  the scalar templates.
- **`src/math/Mat4.h`:** row-major 4x4 (`m[row][col]`) with translation
  in column 3. Static constructors `identity`, `translation(Vec3)`,
  `scale(Vec3)`. `operator*` for matrix multiply. Free functions
  `transform_point` (homogeneous w=1, applies translation) and
  `transform_vector` (w=0, ignores translation). All `constexpr RR_HD`.
- **`tests/math_tests.cpp`:** 42 assertions covering scalar utilities,
  Vec3 add/sub/scalar/compound, dot/cross identities (right-handed
  basis + anti-commutativity), length / normalize (including the
  degenerate-input zero result), clamp/lerp, Mat4 identity / translation
  / scale, matrix multiply with `T*S != S*T`. Hand-rolled assertion
  macro is variadic so braced-init expressions like `Vec3{0,0,0}`
  inside `RR_CHECK(...)` aren't split by the preprocessor. The macro
  plumbing is throwaway — it gets replaced by Catch2/doctest on the
  M2 deferred list — but the assertions stay.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`:** added `math_tests` executable (header-only
  consumer of `src/math/`), `target_include_directories(... src)`,
  and `add_test(NAME math_tests COMMAND math_tests)` so `ctest`
  picks it up. Same warning flags as the main executable.

#### Verified locally

```
$ cmake --build build && cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
1/1 Test #1: math_tests ..................... Passed   0.00 sec
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1
```

#### Order note

The master order has Math (step 4) following Core (step 3). Math has zero
dependency on Core (it is the leaf), so per `docs/MODULE_MAP.md` it is
safe to land while M2's remaining items (`Error`, `FileSystem`, `App`,
`Config::load`/`save`, real test framework, host CI) are still pending.
M2 stays "in progress" until those land.

### 2026-04-27 — M2 configuration + command-line handling landed

Continues M2 (Core Engine). Adds the runtime configuration struct and the
command-line parser that populates it. No rendering, no GPU calls — every
command-line surface is parsed today and acted on for real once the
underlying backends arrive.

- **`src/core/Config.h` / `.cpp`:** `rr::core::Config` plain-data struct
  with `show_device_info`, `render_scene_path` (`std::optional<string>`),
  `output_image_path` (`std::optional<string>`), `width` (default 1280),
  `height` (default 720), and a `wants_render()` helper. The `.cpp` is
  intentionally near-empty — Config is a data carrier; future load/save
  (TOML / JSON) lands here without churn.
- **`src/core/CommandLine.h` / `.cpp`:** `rr::core::CommandLine` class
  with `Status { Ok, Help, Version, Error }`, a `ParseResult { status,
  message }`, a `parse(argc, argv, Config&)` static method, and a
  `usage()` static method. The parser is stateless, dependency-free,
  and handles missing values, non-positive sizes, malformed integers,
  and unknown flags by returning `Status::Error` with a human message.
  Integers go through `std::from_chars` to avoid `atoi`-style silent
  truncation.
- **`src/main.cpp`:** wired to `CommandLine::parse`. `--help` and
  `--version` are handled before the startup banner so their output is
  clean. `--device-info` logs honestly that the CUDA backend lands at
  M5. `--render <scene>` logs `render command received` and exits — per
  this milestone's scope it does not render. Unknown flags / bad values
  return exit code 2 and print usage on stderr.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`:** added `src/core/Config.cpp` and
  `src/core/CommandLine.cpp` to the `RelativityRender` executable.

#### Verified locally

```
$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --help          # prints usage, rc=0
$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --version       # prints "RelativityRender 0.0.1", rc=0
$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --device-info   # logs CUDA-not-yet message, rc=0
$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --render scene.scn --output out.exr \
                                --width 1920 --height 1080  # logs "render command received", rc=0
$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --width foo     # error + usage on stderr, rc=2
$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --render        # error (missing path), rc=2
$ ./build/bin/RelativityRender --bogus         # error (unknown arg), rc=2
```

#### Deliberately deferred (still inside M2)

- `core::Error` type.
- `core::App` lifecycle wrapper.
- `core::FileSystem` minimal IO.
- `Config::load` / `Config::save` (TOML or JSON).
- A test framework dependency under `third_party/` and tests for `Logger`,
  `Config`, and `CommandLine`.
- Host-only CI.

These will be added in subsequent M2 sub-prompts before M2 is marked
landed and M3 (Math Library) begins.

### 2026-04-27 — M2 minimal C++20 application foundation landed

First compiled binary in the project. Scope was deliberately restricted to a
minimal application foundation; config, lifecycle, error type, filesystem
helper, and tests are not in this slice and remain on the M2 todo list.

- **CMakeLists.txt:** bumped C++ standard from C++17 to **C++20** (pinned
  project-wide). Added the `RelativityRender` executable target with sources
  `src/main.cpp` and `src/core/Logger.cpp`, `src/` on the include path, and
  `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` (or `/W4 /permissive-` on MSVC). Removed the
  commented-out `add_subdirectory(...)` placeholder block now that the build
  links source files directly; modules will be promoted to static libraries
  as they grow.
- **`src/core/Version.h`:** `rr::core::kProjectName`,
  `kVersionMajor/Minor/Patch`, `kVersionString` as `inline constexpr`.
  Hand-written, not CMake-generated, to keep the foundation self-contained.
- **`src/core/Logger.h`:** `rr::core::Logger` class with three static
  methods — `info`, `warning`, `error`. Accepts `std::string_view`.
- **`src/core/Logger.cpp`:** thread-safe implementation. `info` writes to
  `stdout`; `warning` and `error` write to `stderr`. Each line is
  `[HH:MM:SS.mmm] [LEVEL] message`. A single `std::mutex` serializes
  writes across threads. No external logging library; this is honest minimal
  code, not a stub.
- **`src/main.cpp`:** entry point that logs the project name, version, the
  platform tagline, and a "Core application foundation online" message,
  then exits 0.
- **Verified locally:** `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build`
  succeeds with the warning flags above; running `build/bin/RelativityRender`
  prints three timestamped INFO lines.

#### Naming choice

Constants in `Version.h` use the `kPascalCase` `inline constexpr` style
(e.g. `kVersionString`). This is the convention to expect for compile-time
constants throughout the renderer. `docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` §8 will be
updated to record this in a follow-up doc-only pass.

#### Deliberately deferred (still part of M2)

- `core::Config` (load / save).
- `core::Error` type.
- `core::App` lifecycle.
- `core::FileSystem` minimal IO.
- A test framework dependency under `third_party/` and tests for the logger.
- Host-only CI.

These will be added in subsequent M2 sub-prompts before M2 is marked
landed and M3 (Math Library) begins.

### 2026-04-27 — M1 repository skeleton landed

- Added top-level `CMakeLists.txt`. Declares the project, pins C++17,
  and exposes options:
  - `RR_ENABLE_CUDA` (default OFF) — CUDA backend.
  - `RR_ENABLE_OPTIX` (default OFF) — OptiX backend.
  - `RR_BUILD_TESTS` (default ON).
  - `RR_BUILD_TOOLS` (default OFF).
  - `RR_BUILD_INTEGRATIONS` (default OFF).
  Defaults are chosen so the host-only configure works on any machine
  (no CUDA / OptiX / Cinema 4D toolchains required). No targets are
  built yet — `add_subdirectory(...)` calls are commented out and
  annotated with the milestone that turns each one on.
- Added top-level `README.md` with project overview, status, repository
  layout, and configure / build instructions.
- Created the source skeleton:
  ```
  src/{core,math,image,gpu,cuda,optix,scene,geometry,material,
       texture,lighting,camera,relativity,renderer,pathtracer,
       io,server}/
  tests/
  tools/
  integrations/c4d/
  third_party/
  ```
- Added a `README.md` in every major folder (each `src/*` module,
  `tests/`, `tools/`, `integrations/`, `integrations/c4d/`,
  `third_party/`). Module READMEs are intentionally short pointers —
  one paragraph of purpose + a reference to `docs/MODULE_MAP.md`,
  which remains the authoritative contract.
- Updated this file. Marked M0 as landed and M1 as landed.

#### Naming notes vs. M0 docs

The skeleton uses the directory names listed in the M1 prompt, which differ
in a few places from the planned shape sketched in
`docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` §8:

| M0 doc sketch         | M1 actual          |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| `src/cuda_backend/`   | `src/cuda/`        |
| `src/optix_backend/`  | `src/optix/`       |
| `src/relativistic/`   | `src/relativity/`  |
| `src/scene_format/`   | `src/io/` (shared with image IO) |
| `src/aov/`, `src/progressive/`, `src/denoise/` | `src/renderer/` (umbrella) |
| `bridges/c4d_bridge/`, `bridges/c4d_native/` | `integrations/c4d/` |

These are layout-only differences. The 22 logical modules from
`docs/MODULE_MAP.md` are unchanged; reconciling MASTER_ARCHITECTURE §8 and
MODULE_MAP path references with this layout is a small, doc-only follow-up
and does not affect the architecture or dependency rules.

#### Deliberately deferred

- No source files (.h / .cpp / .cu) added. Module CMakeLists.txt files
  are added when the corresponding module is implemented (M2+).
- No third-party dependencies fetched or vendored. They are introduced in
  the milestones that need them (logging/test framework in M2, EXR/PNG
  in M4, etc.).
- No CI configuration. CI is added with M2 once there is a real target
  to compile.
- No CUDA / OptiX / Cinema 4D detection logic in CMake — only options.
  Detection lands when the corresponding backend module starts (M5
  for CUDA, M15 for OptiX, M19 for the C4D bridge).

### 2026-04-27 — M0 documentation set landed

- Added `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md`: identity, layers, 22 modules, dependency
  direction, forbidden dependencies, end-to-end data flow, planned repository
  shape, non-goals.
- Added `docs/MODULE_MAP.md`: per-module ownership, dependencies, forbidden
  list, public surface, GPU-side flag, status.
- Added `docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`: identity, engineering, dependency, build,
  GPU, relativistic, process, style, testing, and "done" rules.
- Added `docs/MILESTONE_ROADMAP.md`: M0–M23 with goals, deliverables, and exit
  criteria. Cinema 4D work gated behind a working renderer server (M18).
- Added this file (`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`) tracking module and milestone state.

## Next Step

**M6 — CUDA Framebuffer & First Kernel.** End-to-end host → device →
host pipeline producing a real image:

1. Add `enable_language(CUDA)` and `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` (gated by
   `RR_ENABLE_CUDA`).
2. Introduce `rr::cuda::Stream` and `rr::cuda::DeviceBuffer<T>` as the
   first concrete pieces of the CUDA Backend's resource layer.
3. Add a device-side framebuffer mirror under `src/cuda/`.
4. Write the first `.cu` file - a kernel that fills the framebuffer
   with a procedural pattern (e.g. UV gradient) so we have a real
   end-to-end GPU result.
5. Download to host and save through the existing `Image::save_ppm`
   path so the GPU-generated image is verifiable byte-for-byte.

Alongside M6, the M2 deferred items should be cleaned up so the core
foundation is honest end-to-end:

1. `core::Error` — a small result/error type used at module boundaries.
2. `core::FileSystem` — minimal path / read / write helpers using
   `std::filesystem` plus a thin error-aware wrapper.
3. `Config::load` / `Config::save` — TOML or JSON persistence via a
   vendored parser under `third_party/`.
4. `core::App` — application lifecycle wrapper that owns parse → run →
   exit.
5. A real test framework (Catch2 or doctest) under `third_party/`,
   migrating the existing test runners.
6. Host-only CI configuration that runs the build and tests.

Per development rules, none of these may introduce code from M7+
modules - no camera, scene, material, or rendering code yet.
